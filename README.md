# Razor Pages Net 7 Repository Pattern

The repository pattern abstracts the data access layer from the business logic layer. The pattern can help you insulate your application from data store changes and facilitate automated unit testing.

This repository provides a template that implements dependency injection and a generic template for the implementation of the pattern in a .NET 7 Core project using ASP.NET Razor Pages. 

Additionally, the application uses a tiered approach to separate logic into different logical areas.
